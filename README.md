## Grant Hizer Analytics Portfolio - SMU Data Science and Statistics '23
###### *Current: Independent Data Analyst | Former: Scouting and Analytics Student Assistant, SMU Football*

#### Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! 

Hi everyone, my name is Grant Hizer and I am a former data science and statistics student at SMU pursuing my passion in Sports Analytics. Ever since I can remember, I've been enamored with sports and numbers. My dad even tells me about how growing up, my older brother and I would constantly argue at the dinner table over which baseball players were better, normal enough for two brothers. However, we didn't have anything in front of us except a plate of food and the desire to not let the other "win" the argument. We were going at it based solely off our memory of the stats on the backs of our baseball cards, and that was while I was only 3 years old!

To this day, I love being able to dig into the details of different sports and find any hidden trends, or unearth any new ways of viewing teams. While I dream of working in personnel for a professional team (any sport) or college football team, I also love nerding out of sports stats with anyone else that loves them. That's why this page exists: to both show off my skills and experience to future employers, as well as have a place for any other analytics junkie to come see my work.  

These projects required knowledge in:
- **Data Cleaning & Manipulation**
- **Statistical Modeling**
- **Machine Learning via Gradient Boosting**
- **Data Visualization**
- **Football Schemes and Strategy**
- **Web-Scraping**
- **Google Sheets/Google Workplace**
- **And much more!**

In addition to those skills, I have documented experience and feel comfortable with the following coding languages:
- **R**
- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **C++**
  

For any questions regarding any of my projects, job applications, current projects, or topic-requests feel free to email me at:
